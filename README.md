## Lazo - High-Dimensional Data Search

Lazo is a library for approximate high-dimensional search. It can index large
volumes of high-dimensional points, search among them efficiently, and give an
approximate answer with high accuracy. Right now Lazo supports two different
search metrics, Jaccard similarity and Jaccard containment; more metrics are
under development and will be made available soon. 

We are using Lazo within the context of data discovery, and in particular,
Aurum. For more information take a look at 
[this project](http://mitdbg.github.io/aurum-datadiscovery)
and the relevant papers in [my webpage](http://www.raulcastrofernandez.com).
